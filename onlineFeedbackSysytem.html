      <p style="width:80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; font-size:
        large;">The purpose of this project is to make the process of taking
        feedback
        from the students in online regarding the lecturer’s teaching. With
        this, the institutes can access the feedback reports in a faster way and
        without any loss of data. As of now this task was done manually with the
        use of papers and pens. This has many drawbacks and evaluating this hand
        written forms is a difficult process.
      </p><p style="width:80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; font-size:
        large;">
        Student needs to logging into the website of online feedback system and
        giving his/her feedback and can perform modifications too. But the
        restriction here is once the student submits the report then he cannot
        modify it later. With this the student can successfully submit feedback
        on lecturer’s teaching in a very efficient manner without any loss of
        data. The administrator and the faculty members can access these
        feedbacks from the students and take appropriate actions.
